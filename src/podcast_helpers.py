    """
    Fetch the latest accessible (non-private) entry from a playlist URL.

    Return a tuple suitable for podcast filtering operations.

    This function employs an incremental lookahead strategy (increasing
    ``playlistend``) rather than fetching the entire playlist when private
    videos are encountered.

    ``url`` is a playlist or channel URL. First, attempt a lightweight extraction
    limited to the first entry (``playlistend=1``). If the call succeeds but the
    entry's ``title`` starts with ``"Private video"`` or the extraction raises any
    exception whose string contains that phrase, the result is considered a
    "private latest" case.

    In that situation, perform a second extraction with ``ignoreerrors=True``
    (no ``playlistend``) and walk the returned list backwards until finding a
    non-private entry. That entry is returned in a one-item list and ``skipped``
    is set to ``True``. ``skipped`` is ``False`` if no private video was
    encountered. The original ``info`` dict from yt-dlp is also returned so
    that callers can derive a playlist label.

    The original exception is re-raised if the playlist has no accessible
    entries; callers may let it bubble up so the existing error-path logic can apply.

    Args:
        url: A playlist or channel URL to process.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - entries (list): List containing the latest accessible entry.
        - skipped (bool): True if a private video was skipped, False otherwise.
        - info (dict): The original info dict from yt-dlp for playlist metadata.

    Raises:
        DownloadError: If the playlist cannot be resolved or has no accessible entries.
        ExtractorError: If extraction fails with an error other than private videos.
        OSError: If network or file system errors occur.
        ValueError: If yt-dlp raises a value error during extraction.

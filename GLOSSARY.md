## Full Definitions

### Playlist
A YouTube (or other web) playlist URL that groups a collection of Videos together. Identified by a playlist ID embedded in the URL (e.g. `youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxxxxxxx`). A Playlist is the unit you add to a Playlist File.

**Podcast is a subset of Playlist** — all Podcasts are Playlists, but not all Playlists are Podcasts.

---

### Podcast
A Playlist configured for audio-only extraction. Podcasts live in the audio Playlist File (`audio playlists.txt`) and are processed with special filtering rules:
- Items are called **Episodes** (not Videos)
- Episodes shorter than 3 minutes are skipped
- Episodes with "(Update)" in the title are skipped
- SponsorBlock integration skips sponsor segments
- Output goes to `~/Music/Podcasts/`

---

### Playlist File
A `.txt` file that contains a list of Playlist URLs, one per line. An optional `#Name` comment above a URL gives the Playlist a human-readable label. There are three Playlist Files:

| File | Quality | Contains |
|------|---------|----------|
| `playlists.txt` | 1080p | Video Playlists |
| `720playlists.txt` | 720p | Video Playlists |
| `audio playlists.txt` | audio only | Podcasts |

---

### Video
An individual item within a video Playlist. A Video has a Video Key, a title, a duration, and an upload date. The code calls this an **Entry**.

---

### Episode
An individual item within a Podcast. An Episode has the same structure as a Video but is subject to podcast-specific filtering before download. The code calls this an **Entry**.

Use "Video" for items in video Playlists, "Episode" for items in Podcasts.

---

### Video Key
The unique character string that YouTube assigns to a video, found as the `v=` parameter in the URL.

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyd3cOxuaQk
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                Video Key
```

The Archive stores Video Keys in the format `youtube <video_key>`. The code uses the variable name `video_id` for this value.

---

### Drop Target
A colored box in the main UI window that accepts URL drops (drag-and-drop or paste) to trigger a download. Each Drop Target is bound to a fixed Source, so dropping a URL onto the "Podcasts" Drop Target processes it as an audio download. Code name: `DropLabel`.

---

### Resolution Preset
One rung of the rendition ladder (2160, 1440, 1080, 720, 480, or 360), identified by its height. Each Resolution Preset owns a Drop Target, a Playlist File, and a tile colour, and downloads the best available quality at or below its height. Which presets are enabled is configurable in **Settings → Resolutions**; at least one must stay enabled. Code name: `ResolutionPreset` (registry in `src/resolutions.py`).

---

### Archive
A text file at `resources/archive.txt` that records every Video Key that has already been downloaded. yt-dlp checks this file before downloading to skip previously-downloaded Videos and Episodes. Format: one `youtube <video_key>` per line.

---

### Live Queue
A file at `resources/live_queue.txt` that stores URLs of live or upcoming Videos that cannot be downloaded yet. A background loop polls these URLs and downloads them once the stream ends. Each entry stores the URL, its Source, and optionally its Playlist ID.

---

## Code-Only Terms

These terms appear in code and are documented here for reference, but prefer the plain-English equivalents above in conversation.

### Source
A string routing key that flows through the download pipeline to determine:
- Which Playlist File to load
- Output directory and filename template
- Download format (video height or audio codec)
- Filtering rules (match filter, podcast filtering)

Common values: `"1080playlists"`, `"720playlists"`, `"audio_playlists"`, `"audio"`, `"1080"`, `"720"`.

### Entry
The yt-dlp Python dict representing a single Video or Episode. Key fields: `id` (Video Key), `title`, `duration`, `timestamp`, `playlist_id`, `playlist_index`. Prefer "Video" or "Episode" in conversation.

### qmeta (Queue Metadata)
A dict attached to each download job that carries routing and logging information:
- `site` — detected platform (`"youtube"`, `"nebula"`, `"unknown"`)
- `type` — the Source value
- `playlist_comments` — dict mapping playlist ID → user-assigned name
- `playlist_id` — ID of the parent Playlist, if applicable

## Term Relationships

```
Playlist File
└── contains one or more Playlists
    ├── Video Playlist
    │   └── contains Videos  (each has a Video Key)
    └── Podcast  (audio Playlist)
        └── contains Episodes  (each has a Video Key)

Drop Target  →  triggers download with a fixed Source
Archive      →  stores Video Keys of completed downloads
Live Queue   →  stores URLs of in-progress/upcoming Videos
```
